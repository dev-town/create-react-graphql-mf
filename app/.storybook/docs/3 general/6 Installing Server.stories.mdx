# 1) Install Server:

To install the server, run the following command within the server folder.

```
> cd server
> npm install
```

# 2) Running the server

To start the server, run the following command within the server folder.

```
> cd server
>  npm start
```

# 3) Run the gateway

To ensure data from other federated endpoints can be resolved, we must start the mock gateway alongside any of these services being actively developed.

> By default the gateway will run against the hosted dev environment's services. You only need to run this packages server if you are updating the schemas / resolvers.



## Server development

The server is a federated GraphQL server with typescript codegen baked in.
Each modules has a schema, resolvers, and repo.
When creating a new module, make sure to add it to the modules/index.ts. (or use npm run scaffold)

###Â Inside a module
index.ts: barrel for export (typically ignore this file)
graphql.ts: Schemas and resolvers for this module
repo.ts: The mock data / fake API requests etc, can live in here.

### Codegen

After updating the schema (either by creating a new module, or updating an existing one), you will want to run the codegen to auto generate the typings.
This can be done with:

```
> npm run codegen
```

> As we use a Apollo federation, it is important to restart the mock gateway after making any schema changes.

> _If it is just repo / mock changes, there is no need to restart the mock gateway._

### Models

Sometimes when creating the services, it is best to use a model for the data.
This allows you to transform data from the model shape to the GraphQL shape.
A good example is when you only have an id for a relationship but need to return back a full graphql shape.
This can be done by adding a Mapper in the codegen.yml file:

e.g.

```
mappers:
    Post: ../models/posts#Post
```

this would map a type of 'Post' to a interface called 'Post' inside models/posts.ts
_The contents after the hash refer to the interface name_
