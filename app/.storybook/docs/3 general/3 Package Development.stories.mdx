# Installing for package development.

This package has 2 parts that need to be running at the same time:

-   [Server](?path=/story/getting-started-install-for-development-server--page)
-   [App](?path=/story/getting-started-install-for-development-app--page)

# 1) App

This is the component that will be added to the main application.
The main libraries used are React and Apollo Client. Thse will be provided as a peer dependency to lower bundle sizes.

By default this boilerplate ships with Styled Components, but replacing this is fairly easy process.
In future updates to the boilerplate, I will be providing options to pick different styling options (i.e. emotion, tailwind)

> There is a basic theme defined in ```.storybook/theme.tsx```, and it is advised you replace this with your own imported theme.


# 2) Server

This is an Apollo Federated Server. It allows us to generate our typings, mock data, and test implementation locally.
These federated services can be deployed to an environment as part of CI to save running multiple api's locally.

A Gateway can be run locally to allow for swapping out different federated servers when actively developing.


**Remember to re-start the gateway when making changes to the schema**
