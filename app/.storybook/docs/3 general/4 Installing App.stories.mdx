# 3) Component generation

We have introduced "Plop" to help with scaffoling out new components within our packages.

```
> npm run scaffold
? Name this component FooBar
? Do you need GraphQL? (Y/n)
✔  ++ /src/components/FooBar/index.ts
✔  ++ /src/components/FooBar/__stories__/FooBar.stories.tsx
✔  ++ /src/components/FooBar/components/FooBar.styled.tsx
✔  ++ /src/components/FooBar/components/FooBar.tsx
✔  ++ /src/components/FooBar/__tests__/FooBar.test.tsx
✔  ++ /src/components/FooBar/graphql/queries/example.graphql
✔  ++ /src/components/FooBar/graphql/fragments/example.graphql
✔  ++ /src/components/FooBar/graphql/mutations/example.graphql
```

> You can include GraphQL to auto generate some example queries, fragments, and mutations
