# 1) Application Structure

The application folder is broken into the following folders

-   components
-   graphql
-   helpers
-   types

**Generally, you can ignore the graphql and types folders as these are rarely touched.**

> You can use the _auto generated_ 'graphql/generated.ts' file for importing certain schema typings throught the application (like input types, and enums).

## Components structure

Each component has the following folders structure (depending on what is scaffolded)

```
__stories__/
    FooBar.stories.tsx
__tests__/
    FooBar.test.tsx
components/
    FooBar.styled.tsx
    FooBar.tsx
graphql/
    /fragments
        example.graphql
    /mutations
        example.graphql
    /queries
        example.graphql
```

### components

The component folder will hold all the components and sub components.
The .styled files are reserved for styling. We use [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) to add styling for our components.

> Keep the naming of the styled files consistent with the name of the components / sub components.

### graphql

The graphql folder holds all the queries, fragments and mutations that are related to the component.
Try to use fragments to generate the props for components that map to API requests. _Granularity is the key here._
After the GraphQL queries, mutations or fragment files have been created, you can auto generated the typings by running:

```
> npm run codegen
```

This will build a _.generated.ts_ file next to each of the _.graphql_ files.
The auto generated query and mutations will come with Apollo Client 'use' hooks, that can use used to execute the GraphQL query or mutation.
[Read more about this here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/).

> Apollo Client is a peer dependency for this package, and its configurations (i.e. authentication, api url) is handled by the parent application.

### Some Best practices

-   Use the generated GraphQL fragments for prop types where relevant.
-   The more granular the GraphQL fragment the more useful it is as props for components.
-   Only request what is needed in the GraphQL
-   Namespace the fragments with the package name (as these must be unique throughout the app)

### **tests**

We use Jest and React Testing Library for our tests.
We also have a mocked Apollo Server that returns random data to ensure easier testing.
The data for specific schema types can be hijacked via the 'mockTypes' argument for the test renderer.
For more global mocked types, these can be added directly into testHelpers/apolloClient.tsx.

### **stories**

We use storybook to build our components in isolation. This allows us to focus on the component while being abstracted from the main application.
Storybook also helps us to document for our components in an interactive way.
