 - Efficient Codebases: Facilitate the creation of smaller, more manageable codebases.
 - Rapid Development: A straightforward CLI empowers users to swiftly generate new boilerplates, scaffold components, and set up GraphQL schemas.
 - Commit hooks: Husky is set up to prettify, compile i18n, and run tests, on commit.
 - Consistent Standards: Maintain consistency across micro frontends with best practices for linting, prettier, codegen, i18n, testing, folder structure, bundling, and more.
 - Familiar Codebase: Enhance developer experience by ensuring a familiar codebase, making it easy to transition between different micro frontends.
 - Automated Hooks: Automatically generate query and mutation hooks, e.g ```useGetUsers()``` for seamless GraphQL integration.
 - Type Generation: Automatically generate TypeScript typings from GraphQL schemas, streamlining the development process.
 - i18n: Automatically namespaced language file generation.
